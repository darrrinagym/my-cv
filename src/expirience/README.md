<p>After xena.exchange, I found that I hadn&#39;t taken any breaks for 10 years. That is, while working in outsourcing, I traveled. But I even worked on airplanes. Once my keyboard even exploded on landing because I had to close a deadline while flying üôà</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve done a few small projects with my long-time remote team, like the twitch ad account service</li>
<li>I was also thinking about some kind of physical business, for example, carbohydrate-free pizzas and burgers (frozen convenience foods) in the wake of the popularity of keto.But quarantine came, and in the wake of panic, the topic of semi-finished products for fitness establishments seemed irrelevant</li>
<li>But I still wanted something other than IT-products. With the beginning of quarantine, I launched a biohacking marathon to raise dopamine on <a href="https://instagram.com/darrrinagym">my Instagram</a>.</li>
<li>Just for fun, I became interested in mobile graphics. I was wondering what I can do using only gadgets. I posted this on Instagram. Subscribers began to demand courses. I ran them too. But by that time I had already realized that the insta-courses was not what I wanted to do. And I want  again complex design challenges </li>
<li>some projects for clients</li>

* Creation of a new modern automation system in the clinic to replace outdated software.
* I did most of the work remotely. But to explore the usability of interviews and testing, I came to the clinic.
* The main request is modernization, but without the painful transition of employees from familiar interfaces.
* First, personal UX interviews were conducted with employees ranging from doctors and technicians to technical staff and administrators.
* Pains were identified and those familiar and comfortable moments of the old interface that needed to be preserved.
* On the basis of real people, the main roles were described, their pains and needs were determined.
* In addition to the user flow of each user, the integration with medical equipment was a special point. Therefore, the design began precisely from the most difficult part of the oncological center.
