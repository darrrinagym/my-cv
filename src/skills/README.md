## Research: 
<Accordion>
  <AccItem>Data analysis
  <div slot="acc-p">Google Analitics, AppsAnnie, Woopra, Session recording & Heatmapping tools and much more. Without data, I can't do a darn thing</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Market research
  <div slot="acc-p">Startups often don't think about marketers at all. I like startupsüòé I often had to combine. Moreover, the line between marketing and design research is so thin.</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Consumer research
  <div slot="acc-p">CJM and Userflows: two parts of a whole. Users are more likely to make an in-product purchase. Therefore, it is often difficult to separate CX and UX. </div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Hypothesis Testing
  <div slot="acc-p">Using both real user tests and AI-powered tools. Although, given my personal experience, I can often predict the testing results üßê.<br/>But if I have been participating in the project for a long time and know it well, then there is a chance to experience the consequences of the "curse of knowledge". Hence, tests are always desirable.</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Task analysis & personas modeling
  <div slot="acc-p">I really like to visualize processes using diagrams. The result of the analysis of how the user achieves his goal is also a diagram, on the basis of which usability bottlenecks can be identified. <br/>As for the personas, I am a supporter of compiling the psychotypes of users, for example, using OCEAN, instead of "drawing" classic personas.</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Design research
  <div slot="acc-p">I think comments are superfluous here.<br/>But, usually it's a huge board somewhere in the padlet or miro, where all the strengths and weaknesses of competitors' designs are discussed in detail. And in order not to be similar to them, there are also options that we can peep in the projects of other industries. This applies to both UI-design and usability.</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>A/B Testing & Experiment
  <div slot="acc-p">I like to use different tools. But often it is Feng-GUI, Usabilityhub and those already mentioned above </div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Cognitive walkthrough, etc
  <div slot="acc-p">I worked with usability back in the late 2000s, when few people thought about usability in principle - so I listed only the popular minimum, but this is far from all that I can.</div>

## Development: 

Most often I act as a UX / UI designer. 

Though I have included HTML, CSS and JS in the development section. 

But I believe that these skills are necessary for designers: for small tasks, for example, for landing pages, where complex business logic is not required, but the visual effect is important. 

The designer will make the layout exactly as intended. And it will do it faster than a frontend developer.

Also, I like to act as fullstack on my own projects.

<Accordion>
  <AccItem>Frontend skills
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p><strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS: </strong>styled components, scss, sass, stylus, etc</p>
  <p><strong>JS</strong>: <br/><strong>React </strong>  | create-react-app, next.js, gatsby<br/> <strong>Vue 2, Vue 3</strong> (composition API üòç my favorit ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è) | Vue CLI, Gridsome, Nuxt, Vuepress</p>
  <strong>storybook</strong>, <strong>bit.dev</strong> | for components<br/> <strong>Flutter</strong> (in progress ‚Äì I am constantly learning something ü§ì), <p> Yes, of course, I know how to use libraries of ready-made components such as Bootstrap, Bulma, Elements-UI, etc. Also I can create a component library from 0.</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Backend skills
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>If large and complex web applications require the separation of roles in the team, then, in terms of sites, I think that now it can be a purely design task. I like <strong>JAMSTACK</strong> and <strong>serverless</strong>. I discovered this stack in 2015 when I realized that WordPress is not something I like to deal with.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little more.
It all started when I tried to make static sites from WordPress. So, I started learning Docker for the first time. Although, the last time I launched it a two ears ago.
Now I prefer to use BAAS (backend as a service), <strong>GraphQL</strong>, SQL databases. But I tried to work with different systems.</p>
<p><strong>BAAS & Databases:</strong></p>
<p>Firebase ‚Äì easy running, but I don't like noSQL<br/>
Supabase ‚Äì without GraphQL and lack of features yet. Otherwise I really like it<br/>
8base ‚Äì testing, I like it very much<br/>
Airtable, like database and headles CMS<br/>
PostgreeSQL ‚Äì no comments</P>
<p><strong>Headless CMS:</strong></p>
<p>Contentful, Netlify CMS, Forestry, Strapi, Airtable</p>
</div>
  </AccItem>
   <AccItem>Some tools
  <div slot="acc-p"><p><strong>For development:</strong> git, yarn, npm, netlify, versel, amazon services, etc </p><p><strong>For teamwork:</strong> jira, slack, asana, airtable, trello, miro, zerohight, notion, zapier, integromat etc </p></div>
  </AccItem>
</Accordion>


## ... and nocode: 
<Accordion>
  <AccItem>When I use nocode
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>When to write code, and when to use NOCODE tools - it depends on the task, deadline, budget.</p>
<p>For MVP testing, it is often faster to use no-code tools. Yes, this limits usability and does not usually scale. But if we need to sit on something right now, let's first make a stool, and then design an ergonomic chair.</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Tools
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>Tilda, Webflow, Anima ‚Äì for rapid prototyping and and sites for marketers or small businesses where complex functionality is not needed. Although, sometimes transferring a site to Gatsby from Figma is even faster for me.</p>
  <p>Bubble, Thunkable, Boundless ‚Äì for apps</p>
  <p>Zapier, Workato, Integromat, Automate.io, etc ‚Äì for automatisations</p>
  <p>Retool, Airtable for internal tools</p>
  <p> but when i </p>
