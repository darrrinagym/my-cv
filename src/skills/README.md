## Research
<Accordion>
  <AccItem>Data analysis
  <div slot="acc-p">For example,<strong>Google Analitics</strong>, <strong>AppsAnnie</strong>, <strong>Woopra</strong>, <strong>Session recording & Heatmapping tools</strong> and much more. Without data, I can't do a darn thing</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Market research
  <div slot="acc-p">Startups often don't think about marketers at all. I like startupsüòé I often had to combine. Moreover, the line between marketing and design research is so thin.</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Consumer research
  <div slot="acc-p"><strong>CJM</strong> and <strong>User flows</strong>: two parts of a whole. Users are more likely to make an in-product purchase. Therefore, it is often difficult to separate CX and UX. </div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Hypothesis Testing
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>
  Using both real user tests and AI-powered tools. Although, given my personal experience, I can often predict the testing results üßê.
  </p>
  <p>But if I have been participating in the project for a long time and know it well, then there is a chance to experience the consequences of the "curse of knowledge". Hence, tests are always desirable.
  </p>
  </div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Task analysis & personas modeling
  <div slot="acc-p">I really like to visualize processes using diagrams. The result of the analysis of how the user achieves his goal is also a diagram, on the basis of which usability bottlenecks can be identified. <br/>As for the personas, I am a supporter of compiling the psychotypes of users, for example, using <strong>OCEAN</strong>, instead of "drawing" classic personas.</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Design research
  <div slot="acc-p">I think comments are superfluous here.<br/>But, usually it's a huge board somewhere in the padlet or miro, where all the strengths and weaknesses of competitors' designs are discussed in detail. And in order not to be similar to them, there are also options that we can peep in the projects of other industries. This applies to both UI-design and usability.</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>A/B Testing & Experiment
  <div slot="acc-p">I like to use different tools. But often it is <strong>Feng-GUI</strong>, <strong>Usabilityhub</strong> and those already mentioned above </div>
  </AccItem>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Neurobiology
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>Any of our emotions is a reaction of neurotransmitters. I studied and study neuroscience even before I came to IT.
  </p>
  <p>In addition to the fact that it was always interesting to me, I use it in my work. 
  </p>
  <p>I trigger the desired reactions in the user&#39;s brain through interfaces. When it is possible to predict and simulate, there is no need to guess, and often you can even save on some testing.
  </p>
  </div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Cognitive walkthrough, design thinking, etc
  <div slot="acc-p">I worked with usability back in the late 2000s, when few people thought about usability in principle - so I listed only the popular minimum, but this is far from all that I can.</div>
  </AccItem>
</Accordion>

## Prototiping
<Accordion>
  <AccItem>Wireframing
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>
  Paper is my favorite. As soon as I use some design tool for low-detail wireframes, I want to add details and make it look like the final product üôà
  </p>
  <p>
  Therefore, the first draft is always on paper. For demonstration, my paper sketches may not be readable, so I also use any hand-drawing application on the iPad, Balsamiq or white board
  </p>
  </div>
  </AccItem>

  <AccItem>Rapid prototiping
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>
  Now: <strong>Figma</strong> or <strong>Keynote</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  Before: <strong>inVision</strong>, <strong>Flinto</strong>, <strong>Marvel</strong>, etc</p>
  </div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Interactive Prototiping
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>
  If there is no prototyping feature in <strong>Figma</strong>: I use
<strong>Framer</strong> or component libraries and frameworks like <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Bulma</strong>, <strong>Ant-design</strong>, <strong>Element UI</strong>, etc.
</p>
<p>
Not so long ago I discovered <strong>Figma-low-code</strong>. The code it generates is nowhere to be found. sucks. But for rapid prototyping with really working forms, it works.
</p>
<p>I list the preferred tools, although usually, as soon as a tool appears, I try to test it. I am still waiting for the perfect design tool. Figma is the best solution to date, but far from ideal.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is even experience with <strong>Adobe XD</strong>, <strong>react studio</strong>, <strong>bubble</strong>, <strong>supernova</strong> and other well-known or little-known tools. For example, <strong>Visly</strong> - which is potentially closer to real-world development, but hangs on my Mac with a large library of components.
</p>
<p>May I not list all the tools? üòâ</p>
 </div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Frameworks
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>In the early 2010s, I discovered Bootstrap prototyping. Unfortunately, I will not say the exact date.</p>
<p>But it was often the best way to avoid double work. Especially when back-end administrative interfaces are being created and you need to think about usability rather than design differences.</p>
<p>There are many frameworks out there now, and I usually choose the one that best suits the task.</p>
<p>Once you have a library of custom components ready, you can create interfaces from your own components as a framework. Which also speeds up the development process.</p></div>
  </AccItem>
</Accordion>

## Web & Mobile Design

<Accordion>
  <AccItem>User flows
  <div slot="acc-p"><p><strong>Owerflow</strong> + Figma are my favorite tools.</p>
<p>Although, I remember the times when I did it in Photoshop. These giant canvases with smart objects slowed my computer down a lot ü§£. It&#39;s a pity that then I used them only as internal documents for development and did not save them for history üòé</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Vision Presentations & Strategy
        <div slot="acc-p">I think no comments are needed here - standard practice. Although I remember the time when I had to prove why it was needed</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Wireframes & mosk ups
        <div slot="acc-p"><p>I&#39;ve already mentioned wireframes above, but I&#39;m repeating myself here because it&#39;s an integral part of the design process. </p>
<p>In addition to functional layouts, at the same stage I am looking for how the product should look, that is, I accompany the wireframe whith mock up</p> </div>
        </AccItem>

  <AccItem>Style guides & UI kits
<div slot="acc-p">
  <p>In terms of visual effects, any project for me
   any project, even the smallest one, starts with design tokens.</p>
  <p>If I&#39;m working on a project from 0 I have standard templates for tokens and basic UI elements that I include in any project.</p>
  <p>If project do not planned to create a full-fledged design system, the project will have a UI kit. It&#39;s more convenient for me to work this way. Later I am converting the whole thing into a style guide for future maintenance. Or I use something like Zeroheight</p>
  <p>However, even so, I immediately envision component-oriented design. I&#39;ve been doing this since 2012, when I switched to Mac and Sketch. Earlier, while working in programs like Photoshop &amp; Fireworks on large interfaces with repetitive details, I also tried to work with smart objects, but it was torment my and freezing my PC.</p>
  <p>There is still no perfect component-oriented design tool that integrates seamlessly into the design and development process. About half a year ago, I even started building the architecture of how it should work in my spare time. But I understand that this is the work of more than one person and requires strong investment support. I also continue to research potentially interesting tools. And I continue to work in Figma</p>
  </div>
</AccItem>
  <AccItem>Pattern libraries
        <div slot="acc-p">Fortunately, we now all understand the benefits of tried and tested components that are ready to use in projects. This speeds up the creation of new features and pages. While the initial design and development of a pattern library may take some time, the following benefits will save time and improve your code base.</div>
  </AccItem>
    <AccItem>Motion design
        <div slot="acc-p"><p>I often joke that I am surprised that psychologists have not yet appeared who specialize in a person&#39;s relationship with his gadgets üòé.</p>
<p>Gadgets have become an integral part of our lives, and many people interact with interfaces more often during the day than with other people.</p>
<p>If we want to get the user hooked on our product, then this interaction must evoke the right emotions, preferably by creating dopamine loops üòâ.</p>
<p>Correct interface animation plays an important role in this. I tend to work with interfaces that require unobtrusive interaction animations. Not very visible to the eye and uses standard animation patterns. And I design them too.</p>
<p>It is more convenient for me to use animation frameworks for this, such as <strong>GSAP</strong>, <strong>anime.js</strong>, tree.js, and others. And also animate with <strong>CSS</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, I can use <strong>Flinto</strong>, <strong>Framer</strong>, <strong>Lottie</strong> (with After Effects or Keyshape), SVG animations and other tools, depending on the task.</p>
</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Production Redlines
        <div slot="acc-p">I believe that the redlining is a relic of the past, from the moment Zeplin appeared. But sometimes they demand (Why? A riddle for me). Although, I am not wasting my time on this. because figma has plugins for this that do it for me. So yeah, I can do it ü§£</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>UX-copywriting
        <div slot="acc-p">Using both real user tests and AI-powered tools. Although, given my personal experience, I can often predict the testing results üßê.<br/>But if I have been participating in the project for a long time and know it well, then there is a chance to experience the consequences of the "curse of knowledge". Hence, tests are always desirable.</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Illustrations & UI graphics
        <div slot="acc-p"><p>To be honest, I don&#39;t like illustrations. I prefer to transfer this part to illustrators. And she herself is engaged in logic.</p>
<p>At the beginning of my design career, I had to do a lot of graphics. At that time, &quot;beautiful&quot; sites were in vogue, plus I worked a lot on game development. This meant that even buttons were often drawn.</p>
<p>But yes, I can draw. In quarantine, I even started to entertain myself on my <a href="https://instagram.com/darrrinagym">Instagram(now stopped)</a> as art therapy. Use only mobile gadgets for animation. It&#39;s just fun. But people started clamoring for courses. Followers even approached me for graphics.</p>
<p>But it was more of an entertainment. I prefer building logic rather than drawing graphics. Although, if necessary, I can.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&#39;s even fun for me. But in small doses.</p>
</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Mention
        <div slot="acc-p"><p>When there are other designers on the team, I can be a mentor. Often involuntarily. When I was heading the game development department at an advertising agency, web development sent me designers every month for internships.</p>
<p>And on the cryptoteam, the designers said that every approach to my desk ends with insight üòé</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>3d graphics
        <div slot="acc-p"><p>Once upon a time I was very fond of 3d as a hobby. It was **Maya**, **Cinema4D**, **Zbrush**, **Blender**, etc</p>
<p>But the skills remain, so sometimes I can even model and animate something. For example using **three.js**</p></div>
  </AccItem>
</Accordion>

## Design Sistems
<Accordion>
  <AccItem>Tokens
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>I am a proponent of the component-based approach, starting with tokens. Although the concept of tokens is quite young, and I used to call them mixins before.</p>
<p>Because I lacked smaller elements in atom design.</p>
<p>Today in figma I also lack functionality for tokens, for example, radii, separation of typography and others, but this is solved by specially prepared files and tools, such as style dictionary, figmagic etc</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Naming
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>If I&#39;m building a design system from scratch, I prefer to call everything impersonal.</p>
<p>Colors: besides primitive, neutral, etc. - continue in auxiliary elements (success, error, warning) and generate shades from 0 to 999 (if the generated colors from 050, 100 are not enough, you can always add, for example, 030, and so on.
Also with typography and other mixins. Anonymity. I didn&#39;t invent it. The default font weight has been numbered for a long time, I continue this logic with sizes, line spacing, and so on.</p>
<p>Except for very small projects like landing pages, I try not to use the concepts of H1, H2, etc., because these html and seo terms don&#39;t always coincide with the interface accents that need to be placed. ...</p>
<p>I also prefer to name radii, shadows and other elements according to this principle. I believe that naming the tokens and maintaining this library is a design task. However, this should be agreed with the developers.</p>
<p>Of course, if I join an existing project, I follow accepted internal standards.</p>
</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Component design
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>The principles of inheritance, even on a simple button in Figma, lead to the creation of dozens of button variations.</p>
<p>I like creating components in code. But when my role is only design, then I document all the properties and show the connection with tokens or other components.</p>
<p>But the more clearly the components are documented, the faster the further speed of work and any changes. Therefore, the creation of a library of components on large-scale projects is always economically justified.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&#39;m a maniac who can talk about design systems and components endlessly üòé and even more so, work on them</p> </div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Frameworks or Custom Design Sistems
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>Components designed for a specific project provide more usability, but it will take time to get started. Ready-made libraries allow you to get started quickly, but with limited capabilities. Of course, it all depends on the project and business goals.</p>
<p>I prefer projects with their own libraries, but I can work with ready-made libraries as well.</p></div>
  </AccItem>
    <AccItem>Maintenance & Documentation
  <div slot="acc-p"><p><p>Any system is a rules.</p>
<p>Hence, this requires documentation and maintenance.</p>
<p>Everything related to design systems is perhaps my main passion as a designer.</p>
<p>And also the creation of documentation.
It also allows for quick design updates and quick and consistent changes globally.</p></div>
  </AccItem>
</Accordion>

## Development


<Accordion>
 
  <AccItem>Frontend skills
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p><strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS: </strong>styled components, scss, sass, stylus, etc</p>
  <p><strong>JS</strong>: <br/><strong>React </strong>  | create-react-app, next.js, gatsby<br/> <strong>Vue 2, Vue 3</strong> (composition API üòç my favorit ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è) | Vue CLI, Gridsome, Nuxt, Vuepress</p>
  <strong>storybook</strong>, <strong>bit.dev</strong> | for components<br/> <strong>Flutter</strong> (in progress ‚Äì I am constantly learning something ü§ì), <p> Yes, of course, I know how to use libraries of ready-made components such as Bootstrap, Bulma, Elements-UI, Ionic, etc. Also I can create a component library from 0.</p>
  </div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Backend skills
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>If large and complex web applications require the separation of roles in the team, then, in terms of sites, I think that now it can be a purely design task. I like <strong>JAMSTACK</strong> and <strong>serverless</strong>. I discovered this stack in 2015 when I realized that WordPress is not something I like to deal with.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little more.
It all started when I tried to make static sites from WordPress. So, I started learning Docker for the first time. Although, the last time I launched it a two ears ago.
Now I prefer to use BAAS (backend as a service), <strong>GraphQL</strong>, SQL databases. But I tried to work with different systems.</p>
<p><strong>BAAS & Databases:</strong></p>
<p>Firebase ‚Äì easy running, but I don't like noSQL<br/>
Supabase ‚Äì without GraphQL and lack of features yet. Otherwise I really like it<br/>
8base ‚Äì testing, I like it very much<br/>
Airtable, like database and headles CMS<br/>
PostgreeSQL ‚Äì no comments</P>
<p><strong>Headless CMS:</strong></p>
<p>Contentful, Netlify CMS, Forestry, Strapi, Airtable</p>
</div>
  </AccItem>
   <AccItem>Some tools
  <div slot="acc-p"><p><strong>For development:</strong> git, yarn, npm, netlify, versel, amazon services, etc </p><p><strong>For teamwork:</strong> jira, slack, asana, airtable, trello, miro, zerohight, notion, zapier, integromat etc </p><p>I can use all these tools not only as a user. I have been integrating and optimizing the setup of team processes back in 2014.</p>
<p>Automation and customization of workflows is the internal usability of the team and this is also design üòé</p></div>
  </AccItem>
   <AccItem>Some comments
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>Most often I act as a UX / UI designer. </p>
<p>Though I have included HTML, CSS and JS in the development section. </p>
<p>But I believe that these skills are necessary for designers: for small tasks, for example, for landing pages, where complex business logic is not required, but the visual effect is important. </p>
<p>The designer will make the layout exactly as intended. And it will do it faster than a frontend developer.</p>
<p>Also, I like to act as <strong>fullstack</strong> on my own projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Despite all these skills, I am primarily a designer. Yes, I can develop a fullstack by alternating roles. However, on large projects, I prefer the role of a designer. And I like big projects.</em></p>
<p><em>Besides, I like code too much, and I can write code for days, even skipping workouts. It is harmful to health üôà and I care about it.</em></p>
</blockquote></div>
  </AccItem>
</Accordion>


## ... and nocode
<Accordion>
  <AccItem>When I use nocode
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>When to write code, and when to use NOCODE tools - it depends on the task, deadline, budget.</p>
<p>For MVP testing, it is often faster to use no-code tools. Yes, this limits usability and does not usually scale. But if we need to sit on something right now, let's first make a stool, and then design an ergonomic chair.</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Tools
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>Tilda, Webflow, Anima, Publii ‚Äì for rapid prototyping and and sites for marketers or small businesses where complex functionality is not needed. Although, sometimes transferring a site to Gatsby from Figma is even faster for me.</p>
  <p>Bubble, Thunkable, Boundless ‚Äì for apps</p>
  <p>Zapier, Workato, Integromat, Automate.io, etc ‚Äì for automatisations</p>
  <p>Retool, Airtable, etc for internal tools</p>
  <p>I prefer design + code as more flexible, but when choosing tools I focus on solving business problems in a specific situation.</p>
  </div>
  </AccItem>
  
</Accordion>


## Teamwork
<Accordion>
  <AccItem>Agile
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>Yes, of course I can work in Agile. </p>
<p>And even predict the cost of agile product development for business üòé</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Remote team interaction
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>Since 2009, I have been physically in the office for only 3 years.</p>
<p>I prefer to work remotely, and in this format I work more efficiently. No distractions. It makes me more productive. At the same time, since 2010 I have been working in outsourcing. Not freelance.</p>
  </div>
  </AccItem>
  
</Accordion>
