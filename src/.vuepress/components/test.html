<Accordion>
  <AccItem>Data analysis

  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Market research
  <div slot="acc-p">Startups often don't think about marketers at all. I like startupsüòé I often had to combine. Moreover, the line between marketing and design research is so thin.</div>

  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Task analysis & personas modeling
  <div slot="acc-p">I really like to visualize processes using diagrams. The result of the analysis of how the user achieves his goal is also a diagram, on the basis of which usability bottlenecks can be identified. <br/>As for the personas, I am a supporter of compiling the psychotypes of users, for example, using <strong>OCEAN</strong>, instead of "drawing" classic personas.</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Design research
  <div slot="acc-p">I think comments are superfluous here.<br/>But, usually it's a huge board somewhere in the padlet or miro, where all the strengths and weaknesses of competitors' designs are discussed in detail. And in order not to be similar to them, there are also options that we can peep in the projects of other industries. This applies to both UI-design and usability.</div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>A/B Testing & Experiment
  <div slot="acc-p">I like to use different tools. But often it is <strong>Feng-GUI</strong>, <strong>Usabilityhub</strong> and those already mentioned above </div>
  </AccItem>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Neurobiology
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>Any of our emotions is a reaction of neurotransmitters. I studied and study neuroscience even before I came to IT. </p>
<p>In addition to the fact that it was always interesting to me, I use it in my work. </p>
<p>I trigger the desired reactions in the user&#39;s brain through interfaces. When it is possible to predict and simulate, there is no need to guess, and often you can even save on some testing.</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Cognitive walkthrough, design thinking,etc
  <div slot="acc-p">I worked with usability back in the late 2000s, when few people thought about usability in principle - so I listed only the popular minimum, but this is far from all that I can.</div>

## Prototiping
<Accordion>
  <AccItem>Wireframing
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>Paper is my favorite. As soon as I use some design tool for low-detail wireframes, I want to add details and make it look like the final product üôà</p>
<p>Therefore, the first draft is always on paper. For demonstration, my paper sketches may not be readable, so I also use any hand-drawing application on the iPad, Balsamiq or white board</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Rapid prototiping
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>Now: <strong>Figma</strong> or <strong>Keynote</strong></p>
<p>Before: <strong>inVision</strong>, <strong>Flinto</strong>, <strong>Marvel</strong>, etc</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Interactive Prototiping
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>If there is no prototyping feature in <strong>Figma</strong>: I use
<strong>Framer</strong> or component libraries and frameworks like <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Bulma</strong>, <strong>Ant-design</strong>, <strong>Element UI</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>Not so long ago I discovered <strong>Figma-low-code</strong>. The code it generates is nowhere to be found. sucks. But for rapid prototyping with really working forms, it works.</p>
<p>I list the preferred tools, although usually, as soon as a tool appears, I try to test it. I am still waiting for the perfect design tool. Figma is the best solution to date, but far from ideal.
Therefore, there is even experience with <strong>Adobe XD</strong>, <strong>react studio</strong>, <strong>bubble</strong>, <strong>supernova</strong> and other well-known or little-known tools. For example, <strong>Visly</strong> - which is potentially closer to real-world development, but hangs on my Mac with a large library of components.</p>
<p>May I not list all the tools? üòâ</p>
 </div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Frameworks
  <div slot="acc-p">In the early 2010s, I discovered Bootstrap prototyping. Unfortunately, I will not say the exact date.

But it was often the best way to avoid double work. Especially when back-end administrative interfaces are being created and you need to think about usability rather than design differences.

There are many frameworks out there now, and I usually choose the one that best suits the task.

Once you have a library of custom components ready, you can create interfaces from your own components as a framework. Which also speeds up the development process.</div>

  </AccItem>
   <AccItem>UX-copywriting
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>lorem ipsum sucks ‚õîÔ∏è. I&#39;ve never used it. Honestly. Despite the fact that in those days when I started, many sinned. The interface should be clear and understandable. And keep an eye on the overall tone of the brand&#39;s voice.</p>
<p>Yes, I can bother with the text of each error message. And I write clear interfaces in Russian or English. And I try to use real data in my work. Either believable json arrays.</p>
<p>And the <strong>tone of voice</strong> is my own fetish. If I design a guide from scratch, first thing I do after researching is the tone document. At least in general terms. Because it this, and not the logo, that inspires confidence, gives recognition and sells.</p>
<p>Everything else changes much more often. Especially the logo. From personal experience, if a project starts with a logo and colors, then most likely the logo will be changed before release.</p>
<p>In addition, it is always faster to change the visual than to bring the tonality into a uniform form.</p>
<p>Even if I need to sit down and give a quick presentation of the project, I will spend a little time doing something like this.</p>

## Development


<Accordion>
 
  <AccItem>Frontend skills
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p><strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS: </strong>styled components, scss, sass, stylus, etc</p>
  <p><strong>JS</strong>: <br/><strong>React </strong>  | create-react-app, next.js, gatsby<br/> <strong>Vue 2, Vue 3</strong> (composition API üòç my favorit ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è) | Vue CLI, Gridsome, Nuxt, Vuepress</p>
  <strong>storybook</strong>, <strong>bit.dev</strong> | for components<br/> <strong>Flutter</strong> (in progress ‚Äì I am constantly learning something ü§ì), <p> Yes, of course, I know how to use libraries of ready-made components such as Bootstrap, Bulma, Elements-UI, etc. Also I can create a component library from 0.</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Backend skills
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>If large and complex web applications require the separation of roles in the team, then, in terms of sites, I think that now it can be a purely design task. I like <strong>JAMSTACK</strong> and <strong>serverless</strong>. I discovered this stack in 2015 when I realized that WordPress is not something I like to deal with.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little more.
It all started when I tried to make static sites from WordPress. So, I started learning Docker for the first time. Although, the last time I launched it a two ears ago.
Now I prefer to use BAAS (backend as a service), <strong>GraphQL</strong>, SQL databases. But I tried to work with different systems.</p>
<p><strong>BAAS & Databases:</strong></p>
<p>Firebase ‚Äì easy running, but I don't like noSQL<br/>
Supabase ‚Äì without GraphQL and lack of features yet. Otherwise I really like it<br/>
8base ‚Äì testing, I like it very much<br/>
Airtable, like database and headles CMS<br/>
PostgreeSQL ‚Äì no comments</P>
<p><strong>Headless CMS:</strong></p>
<p>Contentful, Netlify CMS, Forestry, Strapi, Airtable</p>
</div>
  </AccItem>
   <AccItem>Some tools
  <div slot="acc-p"><p><strong>For development:</strong> git, yarn, npm, netlify, versel, amazon services, etc </p><p><strong>For teamwork:</strong> jira, slack, asana, airtable, trello, miro, zerohight, notion, zapier, integromat etc </p><p>I can use all these tools not only as a user. I have been integrating and optimizing the setup of team processes back in 2014.</p>
<p>Automation and customization of workflows is the internal usability of the team and this is also design üòé</p></div>
  </AccItem>
   <AccItem>Some comments
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>Most often I act as a UX / UI designer. </p>
<p>Though I have included HTML, CSS and JS in the development section. </p>
<p>But I believe that these skills are necessary for designers: for small tasks, for example, for landing pages, where complex business logic is not required, but the visual effect is important. </p>
<p>The designer will make the layout exactly as intended. And it will do it faster than a frontend developer.</p>
<p>Also, I like to act as <strong>fullstack</strong> on my own projects.</p></div>
  </AccItem>
</Accordion>


## ... and nocode
<Accordion>
  <AccItem>When I use nocode
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>When to write code, and when to use NOCODE tools - it depends on the task, deadline, budget.</p>
<p>For MVP testing, it is often faster to use no-code tools. Yes, this limits usability and does not usually scale. But if we need to sit on something right now, let's first make a stool, and then design an ergonomic chair.</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Tools
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>Tilda, Webflow, Anima ‚Äì for rapid prototyping and and sites for marketers or small businesses where complex functionality is not needed. Although, sometimes transferring a site to Gatsby from Figma is even faster for me.</p>
  <p>Bubble, Thunkable, Boundless ‚Äì for apps</p>
  <p>Zapier, Workato, Integromat, Automate.io, etc ‚Äì for automatisations</p>
  <p>Retool, Airtable, etc for internal tools</p>
  <p>I prefer design + code as more flexible, but when choosing tools I focus on solving business problems in a specific situation.</p>
  </div>
  </AccItem>

## Teamwork
<Accordion>
  <AccItem>Agile
  <div slot="acc-p"><p>Yes, of course I can work in Agile. </p>
<p>And even predict the cost of agile product development for business üòé</p></div>
  </AccItem>
  <AccItem>Remote team interaction
  <div slot="acc-p">
  <p>Since 2009, I have been physically in the office for only 3 years.</p>
<p>I prefer to work remotely, and in this format I work more efficiently. No distractions. It makes me more productive. At the same time, since 2010 I have been working in outsourcing. Not freelance.</p>
